        <h2>üìñ Passage 1 ‚Äì Literature</h2>
        <p class="passage">"The train lurched forward with a whistle, and Eleanor gripped the worn leather strap above her seat. She had always imagined that leaving home would feel triumphant, like stepping into a brighter future. Instead, the landscape flying past her window looked gray and indistinct, and a curious hollowness pressed against her chest.
She thought of her father‚Äôs stern handshake that morning, more a farewell to a soldier than to a daughter. He had not spoken a word of encouragement, only the familiar injunction: ‚ÄúDo not disappoint us.‚Äù
The words echoed now, louder than the wheels on the tracks. Eleanor wondered whether she had already disappointed him simply by leaving. The university was far away‚Äîtwo days‚Äô travel‚Äîand though she longed for its promise of books and lectures, she feared the whispers of her relatives were true: that a woman‚Äôs mind had no place there.
The carriage door opened, and a young man entered, his jacket dusted with coal ash. He tipped his hat politely before settling across from her. For several minutes, silence stretched between them, broken only by the steady clatter of the train. Finally, he said, ‚ÄúFirst time away?‚Äù
Eleanor started at the question, surprised he had guessed so quickly. She nodded, then turned back to the window, hoping the conversation would end. Yet something in his tone had been kind, without the judgment she was accustomed to hearing.
‚ÄòMy brother left last year,‚Äô the man continued. ‚ÄòWent to study engineering. My parents weren‚Äôt pleased, but he says it was worth every mile.‚Äô
Eleanor felt a flush of recognition‚Äîhere was someone who understood the distance between duty and desire. Tentatively, she asked about the university, and for the next hour they spoke of lectures, professors, and the exhilaration of ideas too large to contain.
When the train slowed at a junction, the man gathered his bag. He smiled as he stood. ‚ÄúCourage, miss. That‚Äôs what my brother always says. You‚Äôll need it.‚Äù
Eleanor watched him step onto the platform and vanish into the crowd. The carriage felt emptier without him, but the echo of his words remained. For the first time since she left home, the weight on her chest lifted slightly, and she allowed herself a small, secret smile."</p>

        <h2>üìñ Passage 2 ‚Äì Social Science</h2>
        <p class="passage">"Over the past century, cities have undergone a transformation that would have astonished earlier generations. Where once bustling squares and crowded sidewalks defined urban life, wide boulevards and highways now carve through neighborhoods, prioritizing the movement of automobiles above all else. For much of the twentieth century, planners believed that car-centered design symbolized modernity and progress.
Yet in the past two decades, a different philosophy has gained momentum. Urban planners, public health experts, and environmental activists have begun advocating for ‚Äòwalkable cities.‚Äô The term refers to communities designed not around the automobile but around people‚Äîwhere homes, shops, schools, and offices lie within easy walking distance, and where public spaces are designed for interaction rather than traffic flow.
The appeal of walkability rests on three intertwined benefits: health, environment, and community. Researchers have documented that residents of walkable neighborhoods tend to exercise more frequently, leading to lower rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Environmental studies suggest that cities with extensive pedestrian zones emit less carbon per capita, in large part because residents drive less. And sociologists have noted that residents of walkable neighborhoods report higher levels of social trust and civic participation, as casual encounters on sidewalks foster stronger community bonds.
Of course, the transition to walkability is not without challenges. Retrofitting a car-dominated city requires enormous investment and political will. Removing lanes to create bike paths, or converting parking lots into parks, often sparks fierce opposition from businesses worried about losing customers or drivers resistant to change. Moreover, not all neighborhoods benefit equally; affluent areas may attract the first investments in walkability, while poorer communities remain mired in unsafe streets and inadequate public transit.
Despite these difficulties, examples from around the world suggest that the transformation is possible. Copenhagen, long celebrated for its cycling culture, has built more than 200 miles of protected bike lanes and witnessed steady declines in car use. In Bogot√°, Colombia, city leaders launched ‚ÄúCiclov√≠a,‚Äù a weekly program that closes major roads to cars and opens them to cyclists, runners, and families; the initiative has become a model for other cities worldwide. Even in the United States, where the automobile once seemed untouchable, cities like Portland and New York have expanded pedestrian plazas and restricted car access in key districts.
The debate over walkability is ultimately a debate about what cities are for. Are they simply channels for the efficient movement of vehicles, or are they shared spaces meant to enhance the daily lives of the people who inhabit them? The answer, increasingly, seems to be shifting toward the latter. Walkable cities, advocates argue, do more than reduce traffic‚Äîthey redefine urban life itself."</p>

        <h2>üìñ Passage 3 ‚Äì Science</h2>
        <p class="passage">"For centuries, the Arctic Ocean was viewed as a static, unchanging wilderness. Explorers described its thick pack ice as impenetrable, a frozen lid sealing the top of the world. Yet satellite records beginning in the late 1970s have revealed a striking reality: the Arctic is one of the fastest-changing environments on the planet.
The most visible change has been the decline of summer sea ice. In 1980, satellite images showed that roughly 7.5 million square kilometers of the Arctic Ocean remained covered each September. Today, that figure has dropped by nearly half. Scientists warn that by mid-century, the Arctic could experience its first ice-free summers.
The implications of this transformation extend far beyond the polar regions. Sea ice acts as Earth‚Äôs mirror, reflecting sunlight back into space. As ice vanishes, darker ocean water absorbs more solar energy, accelerating global warming in a feedback loop known as Arctic amplification. Researchers estimate that the Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average.
These changes have immediate consequences for ecosystems. Polar bears, seals, and walruses rely on sea ice as a platform for hunting and breeding. With ice retreating, bears must swim greater distances to find food, leading to higher mortality rates. Walruses crowd onto beaches in dangerous numbers, and the timing of plankton blooms that support the marine food chain is shifting. Indigenous communities, too, are directly affected: thinning ice endangers traditional hunting routes and threatens food security.
The retreat of sea ice also raises geopolitical and economic questions. As waters open, nations eye new shipping routes that could cut transit times between Asia and Europe by thousands of miles. Oil and gas reserves, once inaccessible beneath the ice, are now targets of exploration. Yet these opportunities carry risks: increased vessel traffic heightens the chance of oil spills, and resource extraction threatens fragile ecosystems already under stress.
Despite broad agreement about the reality of Arctic change, uncertainty remains about its pace and magnitude. Climate models vary in predicting when ice-free summers might occur. Some suggest the 2040s; others point to later in the century. What unites these projections is the recognition that the Arctic, once thought immutable, is entering an era of rapid transformation whose consequences will ripple across the globe."</p>

        <h2>üìñ Passage 4 ‚Äì History (Speech, 1852, adapted)</h2>
        <p class="passage">"Fellow citizens, the promises of liberty are written boldly in your founding charter, yet I ask you: what is liberty to those who do not share in its blessings? You celebrate freedom with grand orations and fireworks, while millions labor in chains. The contradiction is as glaring as the midday sun.
You tell me the nation was built upon the principle that all men are created equal. I do not deny the beauty of those words, nor the wisdom of those who first proclaimed them. But what, I ask, is their value to the enslaved? To him, your Declaration is but empty rhetoric, a brilliant banner under which his misery is concealed.
I do not speak these words to scorn your institutions, but to call you back to their true meaning. If liberty is a natural right, as you insist, then to withhold it from any man is to mock the very principle you claim to cherish. To celebrate freedom while denying it to others is to profane the altar on which your republic stands.
Some will say: ‚ÄúThe institution of slavery is old, older than our republic, older than any living memory. Who are we to sweep it away in a single generation?‚Äù I answer: age does not sanctify injustice. Time cannot transform cruelty into virtue. If slavery were eternal, it would be eternally wrong.
Others plead for patience. They say the progress of freedom must be gradual, lest the nation tear itself apart. To this I reply: justice that is delayed is justice denied. No nation was ever strengthened by postponing righteousness. The longer the delay, the heavier the burden, until the people themselves rise to cast it off in fury.
Do not mistake me: I do not despair of this republic. Its foundations, though stained, are strong. The principles of liberty, once sincerely embraced, have power to redeem the nation. The question is not whether freedom is right‚Äîit is whether you, as a people, will be brave enough to live by the truths you so proudly proclaim."</p>

        <h2>üìñ Paired Passage ‚Äì Technology & Society</h2>
        <p class="passage"><strong>Passage A (early 20th-century scientist)</strong><br>"It is a truth evident to all who observe the march of human progress that technology is the surest path to improvement. Consider the advances of the past century: electricity illuminated our cities, railways knit distant towns together, and medicine banished diseases once thought unconquerable. Each invention has been met first with skepticism, then with acceptance, and finally with gratitude.
The lesson is clear: human problems yield to human ingenuity. Poverty, hunger, and ignorance persist not because they are insurmountable, but because invention has not yet fully turned its attention to them. When the printing press spread knowledge, illiteracy began to decline. When vaccines were discovered, epidemics receded. In like manner, I am confident that future devices‚Äîperhaps new engines of industry, or machines that lighten domestic burdens‚Äîwill sweep away the ills that still plague society.
There are those who claim that social problems stem from greed, prejudice, or inequality, and that no machine can cure such flaws of character. I do not deny the persistence of vice, but I contend that progress in science reduces its power. The wider the opportunities technology affords, the less grip ignorance and want will have upon humanity. Invention does not merely alter our tools; it elevates our morals by enlarging the sphere of human possibility. To doubt this is to doubt the very evidence of history."

<strong>Passage B (contemporary sociologist)</strong><br>"The belief that technology alone can solve society‚Äôs greatest challenges is alluring, but dangerously simplistic. History is replete with inventions that promised liberation yet deepened inequality. The railroad expanded commerce, but it also displaced indigenous communities. Factories created jobs, but they also exploited laborers, including children. The internet connects billions, yet it spreads misinformation as swiftly as truth.
Technology magnifies the conditions into which it is introduced. In a society already divided, it can exacerbate divisions rather than heal them. Consider education: a wealthy student with access to computers, tutors, and stable housing will benefit enormously from online resources. A poor student without internet access gains nothing. The same device, hailed as a democratizer of knowledge, becomes instead a mirror reflecting inequality.
This is not to disparage innovation; it has brought extraordinary improvements. But when we mistake invention for justice, we risk ignoring the deeper roots of human suffering. Prejudice, poverty, and political corruption cannot be engineered away. They demand policy, reform, and collective effort. Technology may be a tool in that effort, but it is no substitute for it.
To imagine otherwise is to believe that machines possess a moral power they do not. It is human choices‚Äîhow we distribute, regulate, and share technology‚Äîthat determine whether progress truly benefits all."</p>
