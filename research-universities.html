    <h2>Step 1: Defining Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzing your interests – Which subjects do you love the most? What are you strong at?</li>
      <li>Career direction – Where do you see yourself in 5–10 years (e.g., doctor, programmer, architect, researcher)?</li>
      <li>Study format – Do you want an academic (theoretical) education or a practical-oriented program?</li>
      <li>Country selection – Culture, lifestyle, climate, university quality, and career opportunities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: University Research</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Program comparison – Each university's course description, subjects taught, and practical opportunities.</li>
      <li>Rankings and reputation – QS, Times Higher Education, US News rankings.</li>
      <li>Tuition fees – Annual payment, additional expenses (labs, books, faculty fees).</li>
      <li>Scholarships and financial aid – University's internal scholarships, government programs, funding from international organizations.</li>
      <li>Student life – Campus size, clubs, and employment services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Checking Qualification Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Academic scores (GPA/average score) – What is the minimum score required for a specific program?</li>
      <li>Subject requirements – Some universities require specific subjects to be passed (e.g., for medicine – biology and chemistry).</li>
      <li>Standardized tests – SAT, ACT, IB, A-levels, or internal country exams.</li>
      <li>Language proficiency level – IELTS, TOEFL, Duolingo English Test.</li>
      <li>Additional requirements – Some programs require a portfolio, a letter of motivation, or a preliminary interview.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 4: Planning Deadlines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Application formats:
        <ul>
          <li>Early Decision (ED) – Typically in November, if the student is already decided on a specific university.</li>
          <li>Early Action (EA) – Also early (November-December), but it is not mandatory to enroll in a specific university.</li>
          <li>Regular Decision (RD) – January–February.</li>
          <li>Rolling Admission – The university accepts applications throughout the year until the spots are filled.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Marking on a calendar – The student should create their own "application calendar" where they mark all deadlines.</li>
      <li>Additional deadlines – Scholarship applications, housing reservations, visa application time.</li>
    </ul>
